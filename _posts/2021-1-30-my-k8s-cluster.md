title: My Kubernetes Cluster

I've setup a K8s cluster using Digital Ocean ("DO"). DO offer a managed service which provides a full Kubernetes offering without the need to build and maintain a cluster from scratch.

It means I can easily destroy and re-create and have a new cluster up and running in minutes.

I currently have a single node (worker) which is a 'Basic / 2 GB / 1 vCPU' droplet. DO provide and manage the master seperately.
